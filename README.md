# Time Is Precious

## Contribution Guide

**Don't forget to create a new branch based on the master branch when working on a new feature!!**

### Step by Step

1. Indicate which part you will be working on in the issues page.
1. Create a new branch with a descriptive name of the new thing you will be doing.
   Ex) `combo-attack`, `double-jump`, `stage2`, etc.
   **Create a new branch while you are on the master branch.**
1. Do whatever you need to do.
1. Commit your changes. (Multiple commits are also fine.)
1. Push your commits to the remote repo with the same branch name.
   (You will be creating a new branch with the same name in the remote repo.)
1. Create a pull request from your new branch to the master branch.
1. Get feedbacks from teammates.
1. If you need to make changes, make new commits and push to the remote. The pull request will automatically update itself.
1. When everything is good, someone will merge the pull request. It could be yourself!

### Things to Note

- Only work on the feature the branch is intended for. Doing other things will result in merge conflicts. They can be solved, but the process is very tedious and error-prone.
- New ideas can be posted in the issues page.
- Commit messages do not need to be in past tense. Commit messages are for what you *did* anyways, not what you'll do or something.
- Write some descriptions on what you did in your commit messages. It will be much easier to track things later on.
